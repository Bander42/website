                these videos are my first forray into real video work...the ideas, work, or writing is only here for now...
    
           
    
                   I'm hesitant to really call it video becuase the basis is an image sequence which is run through a program that allows the images to blur together and cross-reference eachother in transitioning.
                   
                   
                   i'm trying to use this aspect of the modular patch and play nature of <a class="bisquetext" href="https://derivative.ca/download">Touchdesigner</a> to investigate how we experience memory, trauma, and senses of security on an individual, social, and systemic level.
    
                   
    
                   Visually and temporally, the repeating cycles, the echoes of past, glimpses of a possible future, deterioration of a sense of consitancy, and underlying continual instistance of change mirror my experience with memory in some ways and ultimatly i feel like this line of work will find its way into a more direct preformace of the interaction between myself and the algorithm i created to process these images.
